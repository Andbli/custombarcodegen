CBG is a private app developed to display every barcode in "ean.txt" on a .html interface! Feel free to duplicate the project and use it at your own. 

"EAN.txt" is the "database" of the project. Every ean needs to be on its own line. We also added a tool called "error.html" that detects dupes and invaid ean codes.
